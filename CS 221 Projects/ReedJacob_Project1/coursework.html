More specifically, it is an in足troduction to some of the major Asian religious traditions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, and Zen Bud足dhism, approached through philosophical reflection. Emphasis is on classical traditions, since this provides a solid foundation upon which students are than able to pursue further independ足ent readings in more recent developments. Furthermore, this emphasis permits an extended exploration of the interaction among contemporary economic, sociological and religious devel足opments and classical traditions.
